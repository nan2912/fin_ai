# FINANCIAL APP
This project is a comprehensive Business Intelligence Suite built with Streamlit, designed to streamline financial analysis and reporting for businesses and professionals. It integrates three powerful modules into a single, easy-to-use web application: an Accounting Module for managing and analyzing transactions with CSV import/export and trial balance features; a Tax Risk Analysis Dashboard that enables users to upload their own datasets for interactive exploration, visualization, and machine learning-based tax risk prediction; and a Finance ML Report Generator that leverages advanced machine learning models to generate predictive analytics and time series forecasts from uploaded financial statements. The app features a modern, professional interface with sidebar navigation, supports drag-and-drop file uploads, and provides actionable insights through dynamic dashboards and reports. With robust error handling and support for custom data, this suite empowers users to make informed financial decisions efficiently and accurately.
